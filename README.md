### Shapes
Three groups:
- Male Groups with Male icons and Light Blue
- Female Groups with Female icons and light pink
- Others with circle (Random Colors)

### Description
The Three groups: Male , Female, and Others are flocking together, that are aligned, and can not be separated (I make a coheision in it)
The background color can be changed when player press mouse from left to right.

### Artist Statements
My topic of PA4 is gender. According to my draft, each of the three groups is united and isolated. The color and icon will show each of them has same gender, but random color on stroke show that each person is different from others.
I think I achieve my goal mostly.
